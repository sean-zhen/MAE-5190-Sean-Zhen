<h3>Project Overview</h3>
For our MAE 4272 class, our group designed and tested a set of 3D-printed wind turbine blades to maximize power generation. The objective was to optimize the blade geometry (chord length and pitch) for a Weibull distribution wind profile with a mean speed of 4.59 m/s. The design had to operate within several mechanical and material constraints, such as operating the blades under a max operating speed of 3500 RPM and ensuring our blades do not fail during operation.

<h3>Design Process</h3>
We selected a NACA 4412 airfoil profile for its reliable performance across a range of Reynolds numbers. We created a MATLAB script to generate a blade design using airfoil theory. The model divided the blade into 10 radial sections where we iteratively solved for induction factors and swept through pitch angles and rotation rates to maximize torque. Some assumptions we made for our design are assuming isotropic material properties and neglecting tip losses for simplicity. Our analysis determined that an operational speed of 800 RPM would generate the maximum theoretical power of 2.67 W at the mean wind speed without exceeding system torque limits. We also performed a stress analysis that confrimed the design could withstand the 95th percentile wind speed without failure.

<h3>Results</h3>
We evaluated the blades in a wind tunnel at three wind speeds: the 5th, average, and 95th percentiles of the Weibull distribution. For each speed, we generated a power curve by incrementally increasing the resistive torque from a particle brake and measuring the resulting RPM and power output (shown in Figure 2). Based on our generated power curves, the experimental optimal RPM at the mean wind speed was 750 RPM, a 6.25% difference from our predicted 800 RPM. However the measured peak power of 0.214 W was significantly lower than our prediction (shown in Figure 3). For the discrepancy in power generation, we believe that surface roughness from 3D printing created significant drag, unaccounting tip losses, and wind tunnel wall effects resulted in a lower power output.

<h3>My Contributions</h3>
I helped with creating the MATLAB script by providing the methods of calculating lift and drag for each section of the blade. I also created equations for predicting the stress in the blades. I was responsible for data collection and creating graphs for our results.
